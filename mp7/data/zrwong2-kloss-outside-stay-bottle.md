You decide Karlie would want a bottled water. Luckily, one of the nearby food trucks sell some water bottles. You quickly buy one and return as fast as you can. You begin to get closer to the set with your hand raised holding the bottle of water. Karlie sees you and walks toward you. She takes the bottle from you and thanks you. As a token of thanks, Karlie asks if you want an autograph or picture.
