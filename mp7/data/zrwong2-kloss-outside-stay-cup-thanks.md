You decide it is just better to give thanks to the lighting guy. Taken back at your response, the guy notes not many care for the lighting people. You disagree and explain to him that lighting is extremely important for photoshoots. He reveals he is actually the cousin of Karlie and that was how he got this job. As a token of gradidute, the guy explains he can book a time for you and Karlie to meet-up after the shoot. You meet Karlie for coffee after the shoot and proudly show her your cs225 photo mosaic of her. FIN
