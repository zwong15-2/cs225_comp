You decide Karlie probably wants a cup of water. You quickly run back inside the building and get a cup of water from the cafe inside. You begin making your way to set, you are stopped by the lighting guy who is working the photoshoot. He notices the cup of water and quickly takes it from you. He thanks you for it under the impression it was originally for him. Disappointed your plan failed, do you give thanks back or tell him the water was for Karlie.
