It is a crisp, fall afternoon in Urbana, Illinois. Today is Friday, and you are gearing up for the weekend. The time is 1:50pm and your class just ended. As you walk out of the classroom doors you notice you left your slick pencil on the desk. You also notice straight-ahead the beautiful sunlight shining on the sidewalk through the building doors. On your left, you notice your friend chatting with one of your classmates nearby. To your right, you notice a small corridor but are unable to make out where it leads to. Which direction do you use?
