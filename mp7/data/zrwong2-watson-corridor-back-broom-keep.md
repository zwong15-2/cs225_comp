You decide it is your moment to be the hero and keep the quaffle. You zoom in on the opposing keeper and do a couple of nice juke moves to get the keeper off-balance. The moves are just enough to see a window of an unguarded goal post for an easy toss it. With a simple toss, you tie the game. Within a minute, Harry catches the snitch and Gryffindor wins the game. Hermione is now your #1 fan. FIN
