You decide to pick-up what feels like a broom. You mount it and are whisked away from the sheer power of the broom. You fly out on the Quidditch pitch and realize you were trapped in a nearby tent. You fly in the game wearing your Gryffindor jersey down 10 points to Slytherin. You see Ginny flying towrds you and tosses you the quaffle. You catch it and fly towards the Slytherin goal posts. You see Harry hovering by the goal post. Do you pass the quaffle or keep it?

You decide this is your moment and keep the quaffle.
