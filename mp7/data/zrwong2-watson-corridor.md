You decide to follow the mysterious corridor. As you make your way down the hallway, you notice the floor beneath you start to change into rusty wooden planks. The walls are slowly changing as well into rusty wooden panels. You continue walking down the corridor until you come across a T-intersection. The corridor is split in the left and right direction. You see a cat scampering down the left side and a rat scurrying down the right side. Do you follow the car, rat, or turn back?
